# Lab2 â€“ Rust Educational Project

This project is developed as part of learning **Rust programming** and applying it to **mathematical problem solving**.  
It demonstrates how a simple command-line application can handle **user input**, perform **computations**, and display results in a structured way.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The application presents a menu with two options:

1. **Temperature Conversion**  
   - Converts values between Celsius (Â°C) and Fahrenheit (Â°F).  
   - Formula used:  
     \[
     F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
     \]  
     \[
     C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)
     \]

2. **Fibonacci Number Generation**  
   - Computes the *n*th Fibonacci number, where the sequence is defined by:  
     \[
     F_0 = 0,\; F_1 = 1
     \]  
     \[
     F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \quad \text{for } n \geq 2
     \]
